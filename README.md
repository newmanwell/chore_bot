This was a codecademy project in the Building Interactive JavaScript websites. The HTML and CSS was already completed. Some of the JavaScript logic was completed but there was 20 steps needed to complete the JS file to make the game work. I wanted to save this to my local and push to a repository so I could look back for reference as to how far I've come.
